steps to solve issues with installing on windows 

1. install graphviz and pygraphviz manually
	Step 1: Download and install Graphviz

	https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html

	Step 2: Add below path to your PATH environment variable

	C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin

	Step 3: Re-open command line and activate venv

	venv\Scripts\activate

	Step 4: Download binaries for pygraphviz and install in active venv

	https://github.com/CristiFati/Prebuilt-Binaries/tree/master/PyGraphviz/v1.5/Graphviz-2.42.2

	For example:

	In case of python 3.8

	pip install pygraphviz-1.5-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

	src: https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/163
	
2. install MSVC C++ build tools 
    src: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/419525/microsoft-visual-c-140-or-greater-is-required.html
	requires reboot

3. pip instal emerge-viz still doesn't work, not sure if it's because pygraphviz-1.7 is installed
	(while the requirements.txt specifies 1.6)
	The fix is that i download the source code, modified the requirements.txt to use pygraphviz 1.7,
	then running pip install emerge-viz succeeds
	
4. still encountering test run error. issue caused by the use of PosixPath in original lib.
   fix: replace all PosixPath with WindowsPath
